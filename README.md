The footer uses a `<footer>` tag with three main sections:
  1. `.about`: Contains information about the website/company.
  2. `.links`: A list of quick links to important pages.
  3. `.contact`: Displays contact details.

## CSS Styling
- The footer background is dark (`#333`), with white text for contrast.
- Flexbox is used to align the sections and keep them responsive.
- Links are styled to be white by default, with an underline on hover.

### Customization
- You can easily modify the content, colors, or layout by adjusting the HTML and CSS.
- The footer sections can be expanded to include more information as needed.
